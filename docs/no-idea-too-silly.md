## Enterprise stats

*   Demo the product as it is configured, and how we would demonstrate to a customer.  We can get some pretty cool screen recordings.
  
## Building out the network
*  Plot each person joining onto a log - see the network grow.  Show this at the end.

*   Aa we build out the environment, bridge all message to a queue so we can replay
  
*  Hourly / Daily snapshot of the network - see it grow.
  
## Project suggestions for participants


Add some objects to the screen

* A Live tracker of an interesting object - can you plot donald trump on the map?

* Ship or plane tracking (minute by minute)

* Pull ingress and egress stats from the core routers and display on a chart, colour the links according to the amount of traffic flowing
  
* Use the data being shared on the mesh in an interesting way

* Going to try and put together a rudimentary chat app (DW)
